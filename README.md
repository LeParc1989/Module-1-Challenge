# <Module-1-Challenge>

## Description

As a Coding Bootcamp Student, this was my first homework assignment or challenge if you will. That being said, though I put alot of time into it, I'm well aware that I am a novice to the world of coding and being a developer, so your grace is appreciated! If you're still reading, I thank you, and will do my best to breakdown this first assignment for you and talk a little bit about my thought process and overall experience. The criteria of this challenge was to view existing code from a fictitious companys website, and do our best to edit and consolidate the code so that it complies with standard html semantics and also accessibility standards. This may include, but isn't limited to, ensuring the existence of elements such as alt tags for images, basic parent/child elements in the HTML and CSS files, making sure any and all links are working correctly, and getting rid of any unnecessary closing tags, etc. As metioned before, being a student of the craft, im aware that this isnt a project without some mistakes and faults, which is to be expected of a new student and is also part of the learning process. Though, it was great practice for me (and im sure my fellow classmates as well) to train our eyes to look for things that aren't right, and also practice writing a professional looking README file, and overall trying to get the mindset of a professional developer. This will be the first of many exercises and challenges that come my way, while being on my way to building my foundational skills and understanding of coding/programming. Thank you for reading and viewing!
